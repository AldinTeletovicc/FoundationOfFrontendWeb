      <p class="kol">"Following the Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines, the water column filled with particles from stirred-up sediment," says Cai. "Navigating through the low visibility and dense fog during a blackwater dive, I found this female paper nautilus taking a ride on a drifting wooden stick. When I pressed the shutter, the particles reflected my light. The scene felt unusually serene following the natural disaster and reminds me of a fairytale set in a snowy night. As underwater photographers, we aim to shoot in clear water but this image reminds us that grains of sand, organic matter, or tiny organisms are integral parts of the underwater environment. I aim to accept their presence and seek non-disruptive ways to incorporate them into my images."</font></p>

      <p class="kol">"Sea anemones and their symbiotic inhabitants are my favourite targets," says Savin. "A large anemone is like an apartment building with many different inhabitants establishing different relationships and relying on each otherâ€™s character. It's interesting to watch the same creatures day after day and I love to study them as they evolve. On this day I took dozens of shots of an anemone with different settings. Suddenly, as if by magic, a crab came out and sat right in the centre. I just had to press the button."</font></p>

      <p class="kol">"A humpback whale dies a slow and painful death after being entangled in ropes and buoys, rendering its tail useless," says Lopez-Beltran. "The image is a sad metaphor for the slow and painful death that we are inflicting upon our ocean planet."</font></p>
